Java Exercises – Thinking in Java (4th Edition)

This repository contains my solutions and experiments for textbook exercises from Thinking in Java, 4th Edition by Bruce Eckel.

The purpose of this repo is to:

Practice core Java concepts (OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, generics, threading.)

Work through and understand the textbook exercises

Serve as a personal reference while learning Java

The code is organized around individual exercises and chapters, and is intended for learning and practice, not as production-ready software.
